/* Simple interface for weighted directed graphs.

   The vertices are numbered 0 .. n-1 for some fixed n.
   Edges have nonnegative weights.  The value INFINITY, 
   from math.h, is used to represent non-existent edges.

   The two standard graph representations are supported.
   Function cloneGraph() can be used to convert between 
   representations.

   Precondition: all functions except makeGraph assume their
   Graph argument is non-null.
