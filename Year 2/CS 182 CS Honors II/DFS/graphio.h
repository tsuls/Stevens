/****************************************************************
Graphs with names for vertices.
Provides function to read a graph from a file, and a 
function to write a graph to standard out.  (You can 'pipe' that
to a file when needed.)

File format is assumed to be:
- first line is a nonnegative integer N in decimal
- following N lines each have one vertex name (a sequence of 
  non-blank chars, at most MAX_NAMELEN of them).
- remainder of the file can have blank lines; non-blank lines 
have either two or three non-blank elements, in the form:
S T W
where S and T are vertex names, for an edge S->T, and W is a decimal weight.
The W is optional; if omitted, the weight is interpreted as DEFAULT_WEIGHT.
